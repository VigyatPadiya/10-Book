        <p>"Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with this hacking book.<br> 
            While it promised to cater to all levels of expertise, I felt that it leaned more towards advanced readers,<br> 
            leaving beginners struggling to keep up. The lack of detailed examples and step-by-step instructions made it challenging to implement the techniques discussed.<br> 
            Additionally, some sections felt outdated, considering the rapidly evolving nature of hacking and cybersecurity.<br> 
            The book could benefit from more practical content and updated references to make it relevant for today's cybersecurity landscape."</p>
