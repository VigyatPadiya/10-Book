        <P>Jon Erickson is an author who writes a book on Hacking<br>
            The goal of this book is to share the art of hacking with everyone.<br> 
            Understanding hacking techniques is often difficult, since it requires both breadth and depth of knowledge.<br> 
            Many hacking texts seem esoteric and confusing because of just a few gaps in this prerequisite education.<br> 
            This second edition of Hacking: The Art of Exploitation makes the world of hacking more accessible by providing 
            the complete picture—from programming to machine code to exploitation.<br> 
            In addition, this edition features a bootable LiveCD based on Ubuntu Linux that can be used in any computer with
            an x86 processor, without modifying the computer’s existing OS.<br> 
            This CD contains all the source code in the book and provides a development and
            exploitation environment you can use to follow along with the book’s examples and experiment along the way.<br>
