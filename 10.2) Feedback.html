                The goal of this book is to share the art of hacking
            with everyone.<br> Understanding hacking techniques is often difficult, 
            since it requires both breadth and depth of knowledge.<br> Many hacking texts 
            seem esoteric and confusing because of just a few gaps in this prerequisite education.<br> This
            second edition of Hacking: The Art of Exploitation makes the world of hacking
            more accessible by providing the complete picture—from programming to
            machine code to exploitation.<br> In addition, this edition features a bootable
            LiveCD based on Ubuntu Linux that can be used in any computer with
            an x86 processor, without modifying the computer’s existing OS.<br> This CD
            contains all the source code in the book and provides a development and
            exploitation environment you can use to follow along with the book’s
            examples and experiment along the way.
